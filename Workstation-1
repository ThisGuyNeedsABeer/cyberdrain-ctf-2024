Challenge info
Scott Lang has sent a ticket that his workstation is really slow at startup. Like for the first hour he is unable to use the machine. 
He also says the fans start blowing loudly whenever it happens.

He shrunk himself and cleaned the fans, but that didn't help. The flag is the reason Scott's workstation is slow for 
45 minutes to an hour each time he starts up.
